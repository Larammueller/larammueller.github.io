              During my fourth semester I was part of a two-people game development project, which was my first experience with “serious” game development.
              My other team member was put in charge of the games pixel art, whereas I did the whole game and narrative design as well as most of the programming.
              Throughout the project, I discovered my passion for game development and gained enough in courage to pursue that passion,
              which lead to my internship at the amazing Indie Developer Studio Fizbin. For as long as I can remember,
              videogames have always been my strongest source of inspiration as well as cultural companions. I am genuinely enthusiastic
              and at the same time curious about the potential this young medium still has to offer.
