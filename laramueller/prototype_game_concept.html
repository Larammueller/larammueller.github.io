            Prototype (yes, that’s also the name of the game, it will make sense in the end!) was the first game prototype me and my friends finished.
            It taught me a lot about how to adjust expectations and ideas to fit our skills and what you can really do get finished in a certain amount of time.
            My friend did all the pixel art for the game whereas I did the game design, most parts of programming and writing.

              As the player we get to control a silent character who wakes up in a laboratory at the beginning of the game.
              An unknown person communicates with her via loudspeaker and tells us to just pass some tests.
              Whilst following the orders of the mysterious women’s voice, we get to learn more about our special power,
              which is why we were presumably put into this laboratory in the first place: Time only advances when, when we are moving,
              meaning only when the player moves or aims with the mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our progression through more and more test rooms (aka levels) we sometime get access to emails and logs of the laboratory employees,
              which allows us to learn about the background story.
              The aim of the game is to meet the head of the laboratory and defeat her in order to gain our freedom.

            Here are some Sprite Sheets of our Character Designs.
            For the players opponents, mainly some laboratory workers, we have come up with a radiation protection suit
            like design to fit out limitations with only two developers. In this way we could color-code our different enemy behaviors.
            For example: the green one is the easiest kind, they are only static and cannot move, whilst the yellow enemies can follow the player’s track.
            
            <p>
              Our levels, or rather the various test rooms are linked with elevators, which enables our antagonist to have complete control
              over where you’re going to next. This is the case for at least for the first half of the game.
              Later, the teleporter will have some issues and transports you to places you’re not supposed to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make things a little bit trickier, the teleporter is mostly linked to a switch-platform-mechanism,
              meaning we need to find and activate a switch first in order to use the teleporter and progress further.
